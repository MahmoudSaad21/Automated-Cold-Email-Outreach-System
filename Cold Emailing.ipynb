        "#  **Cold emailing**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "This code implements an **Automated Cold Emailing System** designed for businesses to streamline their outreach process using AI-driven content generation and efficient email management workflows. The system integrates various components to handle the complete email lifecycle, from crafting personalized messages to managing responses and logging communication for future reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features:**\n",
        "1. **Automated Email Generation & Sending:**\n",
        "   - Leverages **Meta LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct** for generating customized email content tailored to specific company needs.\n",
        "   - Extracts relevant product information from a **PDF catalog** to enhance email personalization using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.\n",
        "   - Sends emails via **SMTP (Gmail)** with attachments and stores sent emails in an **SQLite database** for easy tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Response Management & Classification:**\n",
        "   - Periodically checks for incoming responses using **IMAP**, categorizing replies as:\n",
        "     - **Not Interested** (ignored)\n",
        "     - **Need More Details** (handled by querying the AI with product data)\n",
        "     - **Meeting Request** (forwarded to HR automatically)\n",
        "   - Uses **Qwen 2.5 model** with **4-bit quantization** for accurate response classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Product Recommendation System:**\n",
        "   - Utilizes **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** and **Sentence Transformers** for efficient retrieval of relevant product suggestions based on customer needs.\n",
        "   - Embeds product descriptions to find the most relevant offerings in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Database & Event-Driven Architecture:**\n",
        "   - **SQLite database** manages email logs (sent/received) with timestamp tracking.\n",
        "   - Event-driven logic ensures that responses are processed automatically without manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Technologies & Libraries Used:**\n",
        "   - **Python Libraries:** `pandas`, `transformers`, `smtplib`, `PyPDF2`, `faiss`, `sqlite3`, `sentence-transformers`\n",
        "   - **AI Models:** Meta LLaMA, Qwen 2.5 for classification\n",
        "   - **Email Protocols:** SMTP (sending) & IMAP (receiving)\n",
        "   - **Database:** SQLite for email logging and tracking\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Usage Workflow:**\n",
        "1. Reads company information from a CSV file and product details from a PDF catalog.\n",
        "2. Generates personalized emails using AI, attaches relevant product details, and sends them via Gmail SMTP.\n",
        "3. Stores all sent and received emails in an SQLite database for future reference.\n",
        "4. Continuously monitors email responses, classifies them, and triggers the next action accordingly.\n"

        "This script continuously monitors your Gmail inbox for unread emails. It handles the queuing and processing of these emails using an SQLite database and external scripts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🗂️ **Key Components:**  \n",
        "1. **Imports & Setup:**  \n",
        "   - Libraries like `imaplib`, `email`, `sqlite3`, `subprocess`, and `psutil` are used for email handling, database interaction, and process management.  \n",
        "   - Email credentials and paths for the database, queue, and process scripts are defined.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Database Initialization:**  \n",
        "   - Creates an `emails` table in SQLite if it doesn't exist to store email metadata (company, subject, message, etc.).  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Email Monitoring Functions:**  \n",
        "   - **`fetch_unread_emails()`**: Connects to Gmail, fetches unread emails, extracts relevant information (sender, subject, body), and stores them in the database if the sender exists.  \n",
        "   - **`mark_email_as_read()`**: Marks processed emails as read.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Queue Handling:**  \n",
        "   - **`add_to_queue()`**: Adds new emails to a JSON-based queue if the processing script is busy.  \n",
        "   - **`process_queue()`**: Processes queued emails once the system is free.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Integration with External Script:**  \n",
        "   - **`send_emails_to_script()`**: Forwards emails to `response.py` for classification and response generation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Continuous Loop:**  \n",
        "   - Runs every 60 seconds to check for new emails, manage the queue, and trigger processing tasks.  \n"
